Ravinder - my friend - I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working with you on the Give development team. You are a wonderful developer and an even better person. While I celebrate your continued growth as you transition to the next challenge in your career, you will be greatly missed.

When I finished the initial release of Ninja Forms 3.0 I had a poster printed with the new codebase to mark the occasion. Unfortunately, the service that I had used is no longer available. But we are developers and we can create the digital world in which we live! So I wrote a script to generate such a poster. Contained above is every commit message on record for the GiveWP codebase for which you are the author. I had to reduce the font size to 2.1px for the text to fit the screen!

May this serve as a small reminder of your influence on non-profits across the globe, for which you have helped to raised billions of dollars.
